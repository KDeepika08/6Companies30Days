Problem statement: 
You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    string getHint(string secret, string guess) {
        int n = secret.size();
        int bulls = 0;
        int cows = 0; 
        vector<int>sec(10),gue(10); //vector size is 10 i.e 0 to 9 numbers 
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(secret[i] == guess[i]){  //If both numbers are same and at same position the inc bulls
                bulls++;
            }
            else{
                sec[secret[i]-'0']++;  //else inc that particular number count in the respective vectors
                gue[guess[i]-'0']++;
            }
        }
        //cows means there is same number in both strings but at different positions
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++){ //the vector consists of 0 to 9 indexes and it has the corresponding ith no. counts too
            cows += min(sec[i],gue[i]); //For eg if sec has three 5's and gue has only two 5's then only two 5's can be matched which is min of both counts
        }
        string ans1 = "";
        string ans2 = "";
        ans1 += to_string(bulls);
        ans2 += to_string(cows);
        return ans1+'A'+ans2+'B';
    }
};
